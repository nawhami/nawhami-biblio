  abstract={To ensure the stability of the institution and protect it from outside influences Hujjat al-Islam Ml. Qasim Nanotwi outlined eight core principles. The goals of these principles seem to boil down to two distinct but interdependent objectives; (1) sincerity and (2) independence. The first objective (sincerity) is required for internal stability whilst the second objective (independence) is required for external stability. This will allow for longevity and maintenance of core values upon which the institution was built.},

Knowledge and good character are required to bring us back in realignment and it is these two traits that the Madrasah aims. The goal is one but approaches differ. Allm.

The book discussed the nature of historiography in six sections; however, the content of these chapters can be simplified under three primary areas which embody Carr’s main arguments; (1) the influence of historians on history, (2) the nature of historical facts and (3) the subject matter of history. This review will analyse these three points by evaluating Carr’s methodology and assessing its place and implication on past, present and future academic historiography. It is being published here to give a snapshot of western historiography so that it may shed some light as to why they may disagree with elements of Islamic history.},

If unsure how it will be treated, it is still worth writing. However, If the letter is likely to be disrespected, the ulama are differed; some say it should still be written whilst others say it should be said but not included. In any case, shortened form or 786 does not fulfill the sunnah.},

Between these are ambiguous matters; avoid them. The path to perfection is in shunning triviality; value your time and health. Know your obligation to the people and fulfill it for the sake of Allah. Trust in Allah; pray and pray often.},
